"""
Tests for ClipForge AI Face Tracker with Active Speaker Detection.

Tests verify:
1. Backward compatibility (no transcript → works like before)
2. Center-crop fallback for synthetic videos without human faces
3. Active speaker tracking with transcript data
4. Speech interval builder logic
5. Output contract stability (all required keys present)
